## Question 1: Mars 

This algorithm runs in $O(n)$ because it is a simple `for` loop over the input
containing a single `if` statement. 

This algorithm has linear space complexity because the input space has linear complexity and the 
auxiliary space is constant. For auxilary space, the algorithm uses two variables, each of 
a constant size (one constant array used for indexing and one counter).
